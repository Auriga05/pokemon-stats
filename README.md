# pokemon-stats

This is a fun project that shows how Exploratory Data Analysis can be done with Pokemon data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following libraries and softwares to be able to run this project. This project was developed in Python2 with
Jupyter Notebook. pip is Python's package manager using which all libraries can be easily installed. Pandas is used for storing
the data set as a data frame and numpy was used for numerical operations. Plotly is a library that can be used to produce interactive
visualizations easily. 

```
Data set is available online at https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon
Jupyter Notebook - For installation instructions, check http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
Python2
pip - Check out https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
Numpy - For installation using numpy - $ pip install numpy
Pandas - For installation using pandas - $ pip install pandas
Plotly - For installation using plotly - $ pip install plotly. Check out https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/
```

You will have to create a Plotly account if you want to create visualizations using plotly. To initialize online plotting, you need to add the following line to your Python code -
```
plotly.tools.set_credentials_file(username='DemoAccount', api_key='lr1c37zw81')
```
